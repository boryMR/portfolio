          <header><b>Requirements to apply    </b></header>
          <p>Students with a minimum 2.0 cumulative college Grade Point Average are encouraged to apply. The Office of Admission reviews the following to determine the academic admissibility of a transfer student:</p>
          <ol class="list-group list-group-numbered">
            <li class="list-group-item"> <b>Cumulative GPA:</b> (computed from official transcripts for all colleges attended). Most programs require a minimum of a 2.0 on a 4.0 scale. Some programs have higher cumulative GPA requirements such as Nursing (3.5), and some programs in Education, Science and Engineering programs (2.3-2.5).</li>
            <li class="list-group-item"> <b>Rigor of College Courses:</b> Most programs require a variety of college level subjects including science, math and communications. Some programs require successful completion of specific prerequisite courses for admission, such as Engineering (college-level math in advance of Algebra II with Physics preferred) and Nursing (Biology, Chemistry and/or Anatomy and Physiology with a grade of B or better).</li>
            <li class="list-group-item"> <b>Final high school transcript or HiSET or GED:</b> This information, along with official college transcripts is used to determine basic preparation for college-level work and may be used to assess if prerequisites for a specific academic program have been met.</li>
            <li class="list-group-item"> <b>Essay:</b> A brief essay on a topic of your choice is used to evaluate written communication skills. This could be about your passion for your field of study, your reason for choosing UMaine, a statement that will enlighten the reader about your academic experience, or another topic of your choice. Essays are optional, although they are helpful for admission consideration.</li>
            <li class="list-group-item"> <b>Additional Academic Information:</b> Transcripts showing final grades for current college-level course work or mid-semester progress reports may be requested if additional information is needed in order to make an admission decision. Applicants will be contacted by the Admission Office if additional academic information is requested.</li>
